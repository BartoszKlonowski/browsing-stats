The purpose of this web-browser's add-on is to allow user to track and gather statistics the time spent on each website.

**How does it work?**

Once you visit a website (no matter if by switching the tab, or entering a URL in the current tab), the extension catches that moment and summarize the time spent on the website you are leaving.
<br/>Please note, that this extension summarizes and shows the time spent for a website in general, not for a certain webpage.
What it means is that, for example of youtube service - this extension will calculate time spent on youtube in general, not the time spent on separate videos.

**Privacy**

This extension does not sends any data to anywhere, but saves the data locally on your machine so that:
<br/>**your data stays with you**.
